    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

So long as your gang is careful not to sell too many items at once no one will suspect that you have discovered a new dome. No risk is incurred by collecting 2D6x10 credits. However, if you want to work the dome more intensely you can do so. A ganger can collect 3D6x10, 4D6x10, 5D6x10 or even 6D6x10 from the hoard, but if he rolls any doubles at all then he has been spotted entering the dome. You still collect the income rolled but the hoard is secret no longer and it is immediately stripped bare by treasure hunters. The territory then becomes an area of Old Ruins instead.</value>

If you decide to run a gambling session you receive 2D6x10 credits. However, if you roll a double you lose that number of credits from that turn’s income instead – eg, double 4 you lose 80 credits.
Note that losses are deducted from your income before making reductions for basic running costs. If a gang is unable to pay gambling debts out of its income then the difference must be made up from its stash. If this still isn’t enough to cover the gang’s debts then weapons or equipment must be sold off.</value>

  <data name="lbl_territory_workshop_description" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The family or friends of one of your gang fighters runs a workshop in the local settlement. You can trade in bits of scrap or other odds and ends in return for cheap repair work or cash. If you want to visit the workshop you earn D6x10 credits.
In addition, thanks to your workshop’s meticulous care, you always ignore the first Ammo test during a battle. It is assumed you pass the test and no dice are rolled. Note that this only applies to the first test, not to subsequent ones.</value>
